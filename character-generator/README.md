- **Character Responses**: Authentic responses based on personality
- **Progress Tracking**: Indicates if sale is progressing or regressing
- **Endings**: Success and failure scenarios

## File Output

Characters are saved as JSON files in the `characters/` directory with the format:
```
characters/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Character_Name.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Another_Character.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables for API keys:

### OpenAI API Setup (Required for Dialogue Generation)

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
npm run setup
```
This will create a `.env` file template for you to fill in.

**Manual Setup:**
1. Get your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   # Copy this to .env and replace with your actual API key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

### Optional Configuration

You can also customize the OpenAI model settings:
```bash
# Optional: Model configuration (defaults to gpt-4)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
```

**Note**: The dialogue generation feature requires a valid OpenAI API key to function. Without it, the system will throw an error.

## Error Handling

The dialogue generation includes:
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for token usage, API calls, and response validation
- **Token Management**: Automatic calculation of available response tokens to avoid 8192 token limit
- **JSON validation with retry logic** (up to 3 attempts)
- **Structure validation for dialogue trees**
- **Graceful error handling for API failures**
- **Skip logic for characters that already have dialogue**

### Token Optimization

The system includes tools to help manage token usage:

**Analyze character token usage:**
```bash
npm run token-analyze characters/Character_Name.json
```

**Analyze all characters:**
```bash
npm run token-analyze --analyze-all
```

**Token optimization features:**
- Automatic token estimation for character data
- Warnings when character data approaches token limits
- Suggestions for reducing verbose sections
- Automatic creation of optimized character versions
- Detailed logging of token usage during API calls

**Common token optimization strategies:**
- Keep life events to 2-3 key moments
- Limit family/friends to 2-3 most important
- Reduce hobbies to 3-4 main interests
- Keep secrets to 1-2 most impactful
- Use shorter descriptions for physical attributes
